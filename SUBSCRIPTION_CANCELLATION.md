# Subscription Cancellation Feature

## Overview
Users can now cancel their premium subscriptions while retaining access until the end of their billing period. This provides a user-friendly cancellation policy without immediate loss of premium features.

## How It Works

### 1. Cancellation Process
- Premium users see a "Subscription Management" section on the subscription page
- Users can click "Cancel Subscription" to initiate cancellation
- A confirmation dialog explains that access continues until the billing period ends
- The subscription is marked as cancelled but remains active until `end_date`

### 2. Database Changes
- Added `cancelled_at` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE column to `subscriptions` table
- Updated `get_user_subscription_status()` function to include `cancelled_at`
- Modified subscription logic to treat 'cancelled' status as premium until `end_date`

### 3. UI Changes
- Premium users see subscription management section instead of pricing grid
- Cancelled subscriptions show "Will not auto-renew" status
- Pricing grid is hidden for premium users with explanatory message
- Cancel button is disabled after cancellation

## Database Schema Updates

### New Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN cancelled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

### Updated Function
The `get_user_subscription_status()` function now:
- Returns `cancelled_at` field
- Treats both 'active' and 'cancelled' status as premium (until end_date)
- Provides cancellation timestamp for UI display

## Frontend Implementation

### Subscription Page Features
1. **Current Subscription Display**: Shows cancellation status if applicable
2. **Subscription Management**: Cancellation interface for premium users
3. **Hidden Pricing**: Premium users don't see pricing grid
4. **Cancellation Handler**: Secure cancellation process with confirmation

### JavaScript Functions
- `handleCancelSubscription()`: Processes cancellation with confirmation
- `loadCurrentSubscription()`: Shows/hides sections based on subscription status
- Updated subscription status handling throughout the application

## User Experience

### For Free Users
- Normal experience, can see all pricing plans
- Can upgrade to premium plans

### For Premium Users (Active)
- See subscription management section
- Can cancel subscription with confirmation
- Pricing grid is hidden

### For Premium Users (Cancelled)
- Continue to have premium access until end date
- See "Will not auto-renew" status
- Cancel button is disabled
- Can still access premium features

### After Subscription Expires
- Automatically reverts to free tier
- Pricing grid becomes visible again
- Premium features are restricted

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can cancel subscriptions
2. **Authorization**: Users can only cancel their own subscriptions
3. **Confirmation**: Double confirmation prevents accidental cancellations
4. **Database Integrity**: Cancellation only updates status, preserves payment history

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Installations
1. Run the migration script: `add_cancelled_at_column.sql`
2. Deploy updated subscription-utils-edge.js
3. Deploy updated subscription.html page
4. Update database schema with new function definitions

### Files Updated
- `subscription.html`: New cancellation UI and logic
- `subscription-utils-edge.js`: Handles cancelled_at field
- `database_schema.sql`: Added cancelled_at column and updated function
- `add_cancelled_at_column.sql`: Migration script for existing databases

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Free User**: Should see pricing grid, no management section
2. **Active Premium**: Should see management section, hidden pricing
3. **Cancelled Premium**: Should show cancellation status, disabled cancel button
4. **Expired Subscription**: Should revert to free user experience

### Verification
- Check subscription status display shows correct information
- Verify premium access continues after cancellation
- Confirm pricing grid visibility based on subscription status
- Test cancellation confirmation dialog and process
